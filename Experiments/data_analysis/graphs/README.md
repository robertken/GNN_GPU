# Experimental Results

The graphs were made from the experimental results. It compares the training time versus cluster size (2, 4, 8, 16 nodes) for both GPU and CPU for a given dataset size and NN model size.

For example, the "big6000k.png" file graphs the training time for the largest dataset size and the largest NN size.

* NN Size
	* Big: 69M trainable parameters
	* Med: 6M trainable parameters
	* Small: 34k trainable parameters
* Data Size (number of training instances)
	* 60k: ~5MB
	* 600k: ~50MB
	* 6000k: ~5GB
