/**
  * Generalized Neural Network Interface
  *
  * <p>Provides a generalized ECL interface to Keras over Tensorflow.  It supports the Keras Functional
  * API as well as the Sequential API.
  * <p>The Functional style allows models to be defined as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing branching
  * and merging among the layers. It is required for models that have multiple inputs or outputs.
  * For an annotated example using the Functional model with multiple inputs and outputs, see
  * Test/FuncModelTest.ecl
  * <p>The Sequential stle is a bit simpler, but requires a strict sequence of layers, each one feeding
  * into the next.  For an annotated example using the Sequential model, see Test/ClassicTest.ecl
  * <p>THEORY OF OPERATION
  * <p>A Keras / TF model is built on each HPCC node and training data is distributed among the nodes.
  * Distributed Synchronous Batch Gradient Descent is performed across nodes, synchronizing weights
  * periodically based on the 'batchSize' parameter.  Each function performs its work in a
  * distributed manner, using the built-in parallelization of HPCC.
  * <p>PROGRAM FLOW
  * <p>The flow of a program using this interface is as follows:<ul>
  * <li>GetSession() -- Initialized Keras / TF and returns a session token. This must be called
  * before any other operations.</li>
  * <li>DefineModel(...) -- Construct a Keras Sequential model by providing a list of Python statements, one
  * to construct each layer of the neural network as well as an optional compile definition statement.</li>
  * <li>DefineFuncModel(...) -- Construct a Keras Functional Model.  This allows construction of
  * complex models that cannot be expressed as a sequential set of layers. These include models with multiple
  * inputs or outputs, or models that use divergence or convergence among different layers.</li>
  * <li>CompileMod(...) -- (Optional) Pass the Keras model compilation statement and perform it on
  * the model.  This is only required if the compile definition was not provided in DefineModel (above).</li>
  * <li>Fit(...) -- Trains the model across the nodes of the cluster, based on provided training data.</li>
  * <li>EvaluateMod(...) -- (Optional) Evaluate the model against a set of data (typically your validation or test
  * data) and return the loss and any other metrics that were defined by your compileDef.</li>
  * <li>Predict(...) -- (Optional) Use the model to predict the output based on a provided set of input (X) data.</li>
  * <li>GetWeights(...) -- (Optional) Return the trained weights of all layers of the model.</li>
  * </ul>
  * <p>USE OF TENSORS
  * <p>GNNI uses Tensors (effectively N-dimensional array representations) to provide data and weights in
  * and out of Keras / TF.  See the included Tensor module for details.  These Tensor datasets provide an
  * efficient way to store, distribute, and process N-Dimensional data.  The data is packed into 'slices',
  * which can be either sparse or dense, for efficiency and scalability purposes.
  * <p>Tensors can be used to convey record-oriented information such as training data as well as block
  * oriented data like weights.  Both can be N-dimensional.  For record-oriented data, the first shape
  * component is 0 (unspecified) indicating that it can hold an arbitrary set of records.
  * <p>For models with multiple inputs or outputs, Tensor Lists are used (see Tensor.ecl for details),
  * with one Tensor per input or output.
  * <p>USE OF NumericField
  * <p>GNNI also provides a set of interfaces which take in and emit data as 2-dimensional NumericField
  * datasets (see ML_Core.Types.NumericField).  This is purely for convenience for applications that
  * don't require the N-Dimensional capabilities of the Tensor format.  Internally, these functions
  * translate the NumericField format into Tensors, and convert the output from Tensors to NumericField.
  * These functions have the same names as the tensor functions, but with NF appended to the name
  * (e.g. FitNF(...), PredictNF(...)).  Weights are always returned as Tensors, so there is no NF
  * version of GetWeights(...).
  * <p>SEQUENCING OF OPERATIONS
  * The Keras / Tensorflow operations take place under the hood from an ECL perspective.  Therefore
  * normal ECL data dependencies are not sufficient to ensure proper sequencing.  For this reason,
  * GNNI uses a  series of tokens passed from one call to the next to ensure the correct order of
  * command execution.  For example:<ul>
  * <li>GetSession() returns a session-token which must be passed to DefineModel()</li>
  * <li>Subsequent calls return a model-token which must be passed to the following call.  Each
  * call creates a new model token which becomes the input to the next call in sequence.</li>
  * <li>It is critical that this token passing is chained, or calls may occur out of order.
  * For example, Fit() could be called before DefineModel(), which would not produce good results.</li>
  * </ul>
  * <p>MULTIPLE MODEL SUPPORT
  * <p>GNNI supports multiple Keras models within the same work unit.  Multiple models are created
  * by using multiple calls to DefineModel() using the same sessionId.  The returned modelIds are
  * used in subsequent calls to discriminate between the models.  See Test/MultiModel.ecl for an
  * example.
